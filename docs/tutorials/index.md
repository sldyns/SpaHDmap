# Tutorials

Welcome to the SpaHDmap tutorials. These tutorials will guide you through various aspects of using SpaHDmap for spatial transcriptomics data analysis.

Each tutorial provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to help you get started with SpaHDmap for your specific use case.

We tested the tutorials on the following system:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Python 3.11.9
- CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz
- GPU: NVIDIA A40 (48GB)
- RAM: 512GB

It takes about 1~2 hours to complete each tutorial. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on the [SpaHDmap GitHub repository](https://github.com/sldyns/SpaHDmap/issues).
