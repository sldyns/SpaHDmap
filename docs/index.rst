**SpaHDmap** is a multi-modal neural network that takes advantage of the high-dimensionality of spatial transcriptomics
data and the high-definition of image data to achieve interpretable high-definition dimension reduction.
The high-dimensional expression data enable refined functional annotations and the high-definition image data help to
enhance the spatial resolution.

Based on the high-definition embeddings and the reconstruction of gene expressions, SpaHDmap can then perform
high-definition downstream analyses, such as spatial domain detection, gene expression recovery, and identification of
embedding-associated genes as well as high-definition cluster-associated genes.

Key Features of SpaHDmap
---------------------------
- Integrates deep learning with NMF for spatial transcriptomics analysis
- Supports various spatial transcriptomics platforms (e.g., 10X Visium, Stereo-seq)
- Generates interpretable high-definition embeddings and spatial clusters
- Enables simultaneous analysis of multiple samples
- Provides visualization tools for easy interpretation of results
- Offers both Python API and command-line interface for flexibility
- Allows selection of the optimal embedding dimension for improved interpretability.
- Supports transferring a pre-trained model to new datasets.
- Enables spatial domain refinement to capture biological sub-structures.
- Facilitates differential expression and GO enrichment analysis for detected high-resolution clusters.
